# viewports-showcase

This is a webapp meant to allow users to interactively try out the different viewports provided by libGDX. **It is deployed [here](https://crykn.github.io/viewports-showcase/).** Find out more about viewports in the [wiki](https://libgdx.com/wiki/graphics/viewports).

_Based on libgdx's [`ViewportTest1`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/ViewportTest1.java)._
